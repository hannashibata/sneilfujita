                <p class="quote">By accident, I happened to find a book in my high school library by a guy named S. Neil
                    Fujita [...] it was called <cite>Aim for a Job in Graphic Design/Art.</cite> I opened the book up,
                    and it was like receiving an instruction manual for my future career: it was all right there. I was
                    about 15 at the time, and I thought, “This is what I want to do.” I didn&rsquo;t know a single
                    living graphic designer, and no one I knew did anything even resembling graphic design; but all of a
                    sudden, I saw this path. To a certain degree, that was the last big decision I made about my
                    life&rsquo;s work.

                        <h5>Born on the island of Kauai, Hawai&lsquo;i, in 1921 as a Japanese-American Nisei, S. Neil
                            Fujita&rsquo;s journey to devote himself to art and design began when he sailed out of his
                            home. His portfolio is rich in colors—starting a design department for Columbia Records,
                            creating jazz album covers, movie titles, book covers, painting, writing, and teaching at
                            top design schools. That journey was not so easy, though. Like many other
                            Japanese-Americans, his life was disrupted by World War 2 and the issue of Executive Order
                            9066. While these events do not look to overshadow his prolific portfolio, his works reflect
                            Fujita&rsquo;s resilience and fearlessness.</h5>

                                    located about 125 miles from Honolulu. He was sent to a boarding school in Honolulu
                                    when he was in high school, where the teachers encouraged him to pursue art. Upon
                                    graduation, he sailed out from Hawaii, heading to Los Angeles, where he enrolled at
                                    Chouinard Art Institute.</p>

                            unconstitutional removal of more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans of West Coast to to 10
                            incarceration sites in the further inland. The government made no charges against them, and
                            all lost personal liberties; most lost homes and property as well. More than half of them
                            were American citizens, and Fujita was among them.</h5>

                        Heart Mountain Relocation Center was one of the ten incarceration sites built in further inland
                        usually remote and isolated, such as Tule Lake (where dissidents were gathered) and Manzanar in
                        California, Gila River and Poston in Arizona, Jerome and Rohwer in Arkansas, Minidoka in Idaho,
                        Topaz in Utah, Granada in Colorado, and Heart Mountain in Wyoming where Fujita was sent to.
                        According to the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/japanese-relocation"
                            target="_blank">National Archives</a>, Incarceration rates were significantly lower in the
                        territory of Hawaii, where Japanese Americans made up over one-third of the population and their
                        labor was needed to sustain the economy. However, martial law had been declared in Hawai&lsquo;i
                        immediately following the Pearl Harbor attack, and the Army issued hundreds of military orders,
                        some applicable only to persons of Japanese ancestry.

                        <p>Despite the disheartening condition, Japanese Americans in the camp thrived, building
                            community in each camps. Among those social activities, Heart Mountain Relocation Center had
                            their own newspaper, <em>Sentinel</em>. Fujita took the job as an art director for it,
                            applying his drawing to newspaper as well.</p>
                        <p>In 1943 and 1944, the US government realized that they need more men than ever; even if they
                            were &ldquo;enemy aliens.&rdquo; President Roosevelt activated the 442nd Regimental Combat
                            Team on February 1, 1943, an Army unit comprised of Japanese Americans. Fujita volunteered
                            himself to join, and was sent to the training facility, Camp Shelby in Mississippi. In the
                            documentary, <em>Masters of Modern Design: The Art of the Japanese American Experience</em>,
                            Fujita saids that he trained four months there. On April 22, 1944, the unit left Camp Shelby
                            setting off to Europe for their first overseas assignment. In the interview with Steven
                            Heller, Fujita states that he served in assignments in the Western Pacific, including East
                            Asia, the Philippines and Calcutta.

                            wife, Aiko Tamaki. Upon completing his studies, his mentors recommended to travel east to
                            look for opportunities. He joined NW Ayer & Sons in Philadelphia, where he worked on an
                            advertising for Container Corporation America (1952). This piece was awarded gold medal from
                            the Art Directors Club. Soon after, William Golden (1911&ndash;1959), the art director of
                            CBS contacted Fujita to lead a new art department at Columbia Records.</p>

                        <p>Fujita took the offer and joined Columbia Records in 1954. At Columbia, Fujita became one of
                            the first graphic designers to employ both men and women in a racially integrated office,
                            collaborating with painters, photographers, and illustrators for the production of album
                            artwork. The list of artists include names such as Andy Warhol, Ben Shahn, and Milton
                            Glazer. Fujita created around 50 jazz album covers, including numbers of iconic albums from
                            Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, the Jazz Messengers, and Charles Mingus, among others. Jazz album
                            was the peak of pop culture at that time.

                        <p>With the intention of expanding his portfolio, he left Columbia Records in 1957. As he
                            intended, his career as a graphic designer flourishes; his following works include, the book
                            cover for <em>The Godfather</em> by Mario Puzo and <em>In Cold Blood</em> by Truman Capote.
                            He quickly became John Updike's designer of choice. He worked on logos for the Today Show,
                            Record Source International, and Shubert Theaters. </p>

                        <p>While tail blazing in graphic design, he continued to draw, and even picked up new learnings;
                            he went to Columbia University at night to study English literature and writing. In 1968,
                            Fujita wrote <em>Aim for a Job in Graphic Design/Art</em>, part of a self-help series of
                            books, which inspired young students to coming into design. Among them is Michael Bierut.
                            Fujita later taught in top design schools such as Philadelphia Museum College of Art (now
                            University of the Arts) in Philadelphia, <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/"
